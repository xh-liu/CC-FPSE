## Installation

Clone this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xh-liu/CC-FPSE.git
cd CC-FPSE/
```

This code requires PyTorch 1.1+ and python 3+. Please install dependencies by
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The results reported in the paper is trained on 16 TITANX GPUs.

## Dataset Preparation

Follow the dataset preparation process in [SPADE](https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE).

## Generating Images Using Pretrained Model

1. Download the pretrained models from [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m4JMtKLDfcXCW1HXHKz-fP6y3_SAaUqX), and extract it to 'checkpoints/'.

2. Generate images using the pretrained model with test_coco.sh, test_ade.sh, and test_cityscapes.sh.

3. The outputs images are stored at `./results/[type]_pretrained/` by default. You can view them using the autogenerated HTML file in the directory.

## Training New Models

New models can be trained with train.sh. This is an example of training the model on one machine.
